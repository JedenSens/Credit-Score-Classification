# Credit-Score-Classification



## 📊 Project Overview

As part of a group project for our Master's in Data Science, we developed a system to automate customer segmentation based on credit scores. This project allowed us to apply our academic knowledge to a practical financial challenge.

### 🎯 Main Objective
Create a robust system capable of segmenting customers into credit score grades:
- 🟢 Good
- 🟡 Standard
- 🔴 Poor

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- R for Data Analysis and Modeling
- Machine Learning algorithms for classification
- Data Visualization techniques

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
- `scripts`: R scripts for Data Cleaning, Data Processing and Model Development
- `CreditDataset.csv`: Raw dataset used for the project
- `Project_presentation.pdf`: Project documentation and report (PT version)
